1. <b>Face mask detection</b>: Contains pytorch code on building a CNN model to predict if there is a face mask in the images. The code is explained in a step-by-step manner for a beginner to make sense of the EDA, transformation, model-building, result analyses and finally testing it on new set of images.<br>
2. <b>Coco Image Segmentation</b>: Built an encoder-decoder based network to predict segment maps of images from the popular coco-image dataset. The dataset is accessed using fiftyOne.
